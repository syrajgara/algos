 each  other.   Describe  the  classes,  interfaces,  and  so  on  that  you  would  use  and  how 
 you  would  organize  them.

 how  each  client  communicates  with  a  server,  how  the  servers  maintain 
 state  with  the  other  servers,  how  state  information  is  communicated  between 
 servers  and  clients,  and  the  speed/reliability  of  their  design.
